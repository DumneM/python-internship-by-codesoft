#TASK-3 .
# A password generator is a useful tool that generate strong and random passwords for users. This project  aims to create a password generator application using python allowing users to specify the length and complexity of the password.
# User Input: Prompt the user to specify the desired length of the password. 
#Generate Password: Use a combination of random characters to generate characters to generate a password of the specified length.
#Display the Password: Print the generated password on the screen.
